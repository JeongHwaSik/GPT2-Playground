## 🏃🏻💨 SpeedUp Results
The results in the table below compare the training speed improvements achieved by sequentially applying the methodologies for speed-up training shown in the graph above. 
The 'Time' column represents the time taken per epoch, measured in microseconds, while 'TPS' stands for tokens per second, indicating the number of tokens the model processes per second. 
Through seven stages of incremental optimization, a 386x improvement in training speed was achieved compared to the initial training speed.
